# Prnt.sc brute forcer

One thing: use at your own risk, and I'm not responsible for anything that happens.

## Install
Open up console and type `npm install`<br>
Open config.json and add your webhook to `discordWebhook`<br>

Then run `node index.js`
<br><br>
Once a prnt.sc code is found, the link will be sent though the discord webhook
